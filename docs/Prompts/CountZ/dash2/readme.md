--> Domain Model de programacao
- Montei um prompt usando llm:
```think
    <think>
        Vamos estruturar a tarefa em partes:
 1. **Entendendo o Objetivo**:
    - Queremos criar um prompt para outra IA que gere uma rede neural em formato CSV.
    - A rede neural deve ser mapeada considerando:
        - Cada linha como um "observador".
        - Cada coluna como uma "camada de abstração".
    - O número ideal de colunas (camadas) deve ser calculado. A intuição inicial é 30, mas precisamos de um cálculo.
    - O número de linhas (observadores) deve ser o suficiente para evitar repetição excessiva, mas com repetição correta para gerar peso semântico.
    - A valência (impacto) e a relação com a qualidade devem ser em função do escopo único analisado.
 2. **Análise do CSV Fornecido**:
    - O CSV fornecido tem 30 colunas e 100 linhas (mas note que o arquivo tem 101 linhas, incluindo o cabeçalho).
    - As colunas são: Indice, DominioTecnico, InterpretacaoSemantica, 24 parâmetros (Parametro_A a Parametro_X), Valencia, Intensidade, PesoComRealidade.
 3. **Cálculo do Número Ideal de Colunas**:
    - O problema não fornece uma fórmula exata, então precisamos de uma heurística.
    - Considerações:
        - Mais colunas permitem mais dimensões (maior expressividade) mas aumentam a complexidade e o risco de overfitting.
        - Menos colunas podem não capturar suficiente complexidade.
        - A intuição do usuário é 30, que é o número atual de colunas no CSV.
        - Vamos propor um cálculo baseado na relação entre o número de linhas e colunas.
    Heurística proposta:
        - Em aprendizado de máquina, uma regra prática é que o número de amostras (linhas) deve ser maior que o número de características (colunas) para evitar overfitting.
        - Podemos usar a regra de que o número de linhas deve ser pelo menos 5 a 10 vezes o número de colunas (em problemas típicos). 
        - No nosso caso, temos 100 linhas. Então, o número máximo de colunas seria 100/5 = 20 até 100/10 = 10. 
        - Mas note que 30 colunas já excedem essa regra (pois 100 < 30*5=150). 
    Porém, o usuário quer considerar até mais de 30? A intuição dele é 30, mas o cálculo sugere que 30 pode ser alto.
    Alternativa:
        - Podemos considerar que o CSV original tem 30 colunas e 100 linhas e o usuário está satisfeito com essa estrutura, então manteremos 30 colunas.
    Decisão: 
        - Vamos manter 30 colunas, pois é o que o usuário sugere e já está no formato. Mas avisaremos que, pela regra prática, o número de linhas deveria ser maior (em torno de 150) para 30 colunas. No entanto, como é uma rede neural com redundância vetorial, talvez a repetição correta possa compensar.
 4. **Sobre a Estrutura da Rede Neural em CSV**:
    - Cada linha (observador) representará um nó ou uma unidade de processamento.
    - Cada coluna (camada de abstração) representará um atributo ou característica do observador.
    - A ideia é que a rede neural capture padrões e relações entre esses observadores.
 5. **Elementos a Incluir no Prompt**:
    - **Número de Colunas**: 30 (como sugerido, mas com a observação sobre a regra prática).
    - **Número de Linhas**: 100 (como no exemplo, mas podemos ajustar se necessário). O usuário menciona que menos linhas reduzem repetição, mas precisamos de repetição correta para peso semântico. Portanto, 100 parece razoável.
    - **Valência e Qualidade**: A valência (coluna 28) deve ser usada como um indicador de impacto, e a qualidade do cenário deve ser ponderada pelo PesoComRealidade (coluna 30).
    - **Redundância Vetorial**: Incluir mecanismos de redundância, talvez duplicando algumas colunas com transformações (mas não literalmente, e sim de forma a capturar relações) ou usando técnicas como PCA? Porém, no prompt, devemos apenas orientar a criação do CSV, não a transformação.
 6. **Estrutura do Prompt para a Outra IA**:
    O prompt deve conter:
    - **Instrução**: "Crie um arquivo CSV que represente uma rede neural com redundância vetorial, onde cada linha é um observador e cada coluna é uma camada de abstração."
    - **Especificações**:
        - Número de linhas
mapei no csv o que e relevante para esse calculo baseado em como renderizp a realidade com hpc. modete o modello para calculo ideial
We are going to model an ideal calculation for rendering reality using High-Performance Computing (HPC). The goal is to identify relevant data points (to be stored in a CSV) that would be necessary for such a calculation.
Key elements for rendering reality in HPC might include:
1. **Geometric Data**: Describing the 3D structure of the scene (vertices, polygons, etc.)
2. **Material Properties**: How surfaces interact with light (color, texture, reflectivity, transparency, etc.)
3. **Light Sources**: Position, intensity, color, and type of lights.
4. **Camera Parameters**: Position, orientation, field of view, etc.
5. **Animation Data**: If the scene is dynamic, we need time-dependent parameters.
6. **Physics Simulations**: For realistic interactions (e.g., fluid dynamics, cloth simulation, collision detection).
Given the complexity, we'll focus on a static scene with ray tracing as the rendering method, which is common in HPC for photorealistic rendering.
We'll design a CSV structure that can hold the minimal set of information to describe a scene for a ray tracer.
### Proposed CSV Structure:
The CSV will have multiple sections (or multiple CSVs) because the data is heterogeneous. However, we can use one CSV with a type column to differentiate.
Columns:
1. **type**: [object, light, camera, material] - to distinguish the type of record.
2. **id**: A unique identifier for the record.
3. **parent_id**: (optional) For hierarchical structures (e.g., an object having multiple parts).
4. **name**: A descriptive name.
Then, depending on the type, we have different columns:
#### For type='object':
- **geometry_type**: [sphere, cube, mesh, etc.]
- **geometry_params**: Parameters for the geometry. For a sphere: "center_x, center_y, center_z, radius". For a mesh, it might be a filename or a reference to a list of vertices and faces.
- **material_id**: Reference to a material record.
#### For type='material':
- **diffuse_color**: "r,g,b" (e.g., "1.0,0.0,0.0" for red)
- **specular_color**: "r,g,b"
- **emission_color**: "r,g,b" (for light emitting materials)
- **shininess**: A number (e.g., 32.0)
- **reflectivity**: Between 0 and 1.
- **transparency**: Between 0 and 1.
- **refractive_index**: For transparent materials.
#### For type='light':
- **light_type**: [point, directional, spot, area]
- **position**: "x,y,z" (for point and spot lights)
- **direction**: "x,y,z" (for directional and spot lights)
- **intensity**: A scalar or "r,g,b" for color.
- **angle**: (for spot light) the cone angle.
#### For type='camera':
- **position**: "x,y,z"
- **look_at**: "x,y,z"
- **up_vector**: "x,y,z"
- **fov**: Field of view in degrees.
- **focal_length**: (optional) for depth of field.
#### Additional Notes:
- For complex geometries (like meshes), we might need separate tables (or CSV files) for vertices and faces. But for simplicity, we can reference an external file in the `geometry_params` for meshes.
### Example CSV:
type,id,name,parent_id,geometry_type,geometry_params,material_id,diffuse_color,specular_color,emission_color,shininess,reflectivity,transparency,refractive_index,light_type,position,direction,intensity,angle,look_at,up_vector,fov
object,1,Sphere1,,sphere,"0.0,0.0,-5.0,1.0",2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
material,2,RedMat,,,,,"1.0,0.0,0.0","0.5,0.5,0.5","0,0,0",32,0.2,0.0,1.0,,,,,,,,
light,3,Sun,,light,,,,,,,,,,directional,,,"-1,-1,-1","1.0,1.0,1.0",,,
camera,4,MainCamera,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0,0,0","0,0,-1","0,1,0",60,,,
This example has:
- A red sphere at (0,0,-5) with radius 1.0 and material id 2.
- A red material (diffuse red, some specular) with id 2.
- A directional light (like the sun) coming from direction (1,1,1) (but note: direction is often defined as the direction the light is pointing, so we have direction "-1,-1,-1" meaning it's coming
Agora faca para gerar esse prompt para o csv rodar em qualquer llm

We are going to design a prompt for an LLM to generate a neural network in CSV format.
 The key ideas from the user's request:
 1. The neural network should be based on how humans process information (layers of abstraction).
 2. The network should have vector redundancy and columns that calculate repetition (using Python?).
 3. The network will be represented in a CSV where:
    - Each row is an "observer" (node?).
    - Each column is an abstraction layer.
 4. We need to calculate the optimal number of columns (abstraction layers). The user's intuition is 30, but we must calculate it.
    - More columns and fewer rows lead to more dimensions, but there's a limit to the number of columns.
 5. The number of rows: fewer rows mean less repetition, but we need the correct repetition to generate semantic weight.
 6. The valence and relationship with quality must be a function of the unique scope being analyzed.
 Steps for the prompt:
 a) Explain the structure: rows as observers (nodes) and columns as layers.
 b) The network should have redundancy and repetition mechanisms (perhaps via the connections or weights?).
 c) We need to determine the number of columns (layers) and rows (nodes) optimally.
 However, note that the user wants a prompt for another AI to create the neural network in CSV from some files.
 Approach for the prompt:
 We are creating a prompt that will be given to an LLM (like me) to generate the CSV structure and the neural network design.
 Let's break down the tasks for the prompt we are creating:
 Task 1: Calculate the optimal number of columns (layers) and rows (nodes).
   - The user suggests 30 columns. But we must calculate it based on:
        - The unique scope of analysis (what is the input? we don't have specifics, so we might need to assume or ask for data statistics)
   - Without specific data, we can base on general principles of neural networks and information processing.
   However, the user says: "quanto mais colunas e menos linhas, mais dimensoes, mas ha um limite" and "quanto menos linhas, menos repeticao".
   We might interpret:
      - Columns (layers) represent depth.
      - Rows (nodes per layer?) represent width? But note: each row is an "observer", so it might be that the entire row is a vector that spans all layers.
   Alternatively, the structure might be:
      - Each row is a node (neuron) and each column is a layer. But then a node can only exist in one layer? That doesn't seem right.
   Another interpretation: 
      - The CSV might represent a connection matrix? But then it would be a 2D matrix of weights.
   The user says: "cada linha é um observador e cada coluna é uma camada de abstração".
   This suggests that each row (observer) has a value at each layer (column). So the entire CSV is a matrix of size (number of observers) x (number of layers).
   But then how do we represent connections? And what about redundancy and repetition?
   Let me re-read: "mapear uma rede neural com redundância vetorial e colunas que calculam repetição"
   We might need to design the CSV as:
      - Each row: an observer (a data point? a neuron?).
      - Each column: the activation or state of that observer at a particular layer.
   But then how do we represent the network? We might need multiple CSVs: one for the state, one for weights?
   Given the complexity, we will focus on the state representation.
   The repetition calculation: we might have additional columns that compute the repetition of a pattern across layers? Or across observers?
   The user says: "colunas que calculam repetição", meaning we want some columns that are dedicated to calculating repetition.
   So the CSV will have:
      - Some columns for the abstraction layers (the main ones).
      - Additional columns that are computed from the main ones to represent repetition (e.g., counting occurrences of a pattern?).
   How to design the repetition columns? We need to define what repetition we are looking for.
   Without domain specifics, we can assume that repetition might be measured by the similarity of an observer's state across consecutive layers? Or across the entire layer?
   Alternatively, we might have a column for each layer that records the frequency of a particular state in that layer? But that would be a summary per layer, not per observer.
   Given the ambiguity, we'll design the prompt to be flexible.
 Task 2: The prompt we are creating must instruct the LLM to:
   - Determine the optimal number of layers (columns) and observers (rows) based on the input data.
   - Create a CSV structure that includes:
        * Columns for the abstraction layers (say, L1, L2, ..., Lk, where k is the optimal number of layers).
        * Additional columns that compute repetition (for example, we might have columns that compute the difference or similarity between consecutive layers, or the count of how many times a particular pattern appears in the row across layers, etc.).
   But note: the user says "redundância vetorial", meaning vector redundancy. This might imply that each layer is a vector and there is redundancy across layers.
   We can interpret as: each row (observer) is a vector that has been processed through the layers, and the layers are designed to have redundant representations.
   The repetition columns might then be:
        - For each layer i, we have a column R_i that counts the number of times the value at layer i appears in the previous layers? Or in the entire row?
   However, without more details, we'll design a general approach.
 Proposed plan for the prompt to the other AI:
   Step 1: Read the input data (from the files provided) to understand the unique scope and the characteristics of the data.
   Step 2: Calculate the optimal number of layers (columns). We can use principles from neural network design and the data:
        - The user's intuition is 30, but we should calculate based on:
            a) The complexity of the data (e.g., number of features, entropy, etc.)
            b) The desired level of abstraction (more layers for more complex abstractions).
        - Without specific data, we might set a rule: use between 3 and 100 layers? But 30 is a candidate.
        However, the prompt must be generic. We can say:
        "Calculate the optimal number of layers (n_columns) by considering:
          n_columns = min(100, max(3, int(sqrt(number_of_input_features)) * 2))   [example heuristic] 
         but if the user's intuition (30) is within the range, then use 30 unless the data suggests otherwise."
        But the user says "realize um calculo". We must base it on the data.
        Alternatively, we can use the following heuristic:
          n_columns = min(100, max(3, int(log2(number_of_input_features)) * 10))
        But without a clear rule, we might rely on the user's intuition unless the data is too small or too large.
        We can do:
          if the number of input features is less than 30, then n_columns = min(30, number_of_input_features)
          else n_columns = 30   # because the user said 30
        But the user might have a reason for 30. Let's stick to 30 unless we have a strong reason.
        The prompt should say: "The user suggests 30 layers. If the input data has at least 30 features, then use 30 layers. If it has less, then use the number of features (so that each layer can abstract one feature). If it has more, then still use 30 layers, because the layers will abstract combinations."
        But note: the layers are for abstraction, so we can have fewer layers than features.
        Actually, the input data might not be features but raw data. We are building a neural network to process it.
        We are not training, we are creating the structure.
        So we decide: the number of columns (layers) is fixed to 30? But the user wants a calculation.
        We can calculate the number of layers by the desired compression. For example:
          compression_ratio = (number of input features) / (number of layers)
          We want a compression ratio between 2 and 10? Then:
          n_columns = max(3, min(100, number_of_input_features // 5))
        Then we cap at 100 and floor at 3.
        But the user said 30, so we can do:
          n_columns = 30   if 30 is between 3 and 100 and the input features are at least 30? 
          or we can just set 30.
        Since the user insists on a calculation, we'll do:
          n_columns = min(100, max(3, int(0.3 * sqrt(number_of_input_features)) * 10))   # arbitrary, but 0.3*sqrt(n)*10 = 3*sqrt(n)
        But then for n=100, sqrt(100)=10 -> 3*10=30. So for 100 features we get 30.
        For n=10000, sqrt(10000)=100 -> 3*100=300 -> capped at 100.
        For n=9, sqrt(9)=3 -> 3*3=9.
        This gives: 
          n=9 -> 9 layers
          n=100 -> 30 layers
          n=10000 -> 100 layers
        We can use this formula.
   Step 3: Calculate the number of rows (observers). The user says: "quanto menos linhas, menos repeticao". So we want as many rows as needed to capture the data without too much repetition? But note: the rows are observers, meaning they are the data points? Then the number of rows is the number of data points? That doesn't seem to be under our control.
   Alternatively, if the neural network is being designed as a model (with fixed number of neurons), then the rows would be the neurons? Then we need to decide the number of neurons per layer? But the user said each row is an observer and each column a layer, so each cell is the state of an observer at a layer. Then the number of rows is the number of neurons? But in a neural network, each layer has its own set of neurons. So we cannot have the same row (neuron) in multiple layers? Unless it's a recurrent network.
   This suggests that the representation might be unconventional.
   Let me clarify: in a typical neural network, we have layers and each layer has neurons. We don't have a neuron appearing in multiple layers (except in recurrent nets, where the same neuron is repeated over time). 
   The user might be thinking of a recurrent network? Or a network where each neuron has a state at every time step (which would be the layers)? Then the layers would be time steps? Then the CSV would have:
        Rows: neurons (each row is one neuron)
        Columns: time steps (each column is the state of that neuron at that time)
   Then the repetition could be calculated over time (columns) for each neuron (row).
   This interpretation fits.
   So the network is recurrent? Then:
      - The layers are time steps? The user says "camadas de abstração", so it might be layers in depth, not time.
   Given the ambiguity, we'll design the prompt to be flexible and ask the LLM to decide based on the input data.
   We'll instruct the LLM to:
      - Interpret the input data and determine the structure of the neural network (recurrent? feedforward?).
      - But the user wants a CSV where each row is an observer (neuron) and each column is a layer (abstraction level).
   This structure is more natural for a recurrent network over time, but we can also represent a feedforward network by having each column be a layer in depth and each row be a neuron in that layer? But then the neurons in different layers are different. So we cannot have the same row (neuron) in multiple columns (layers) in a feedforward net.
   Therefore, the representation might be:
        For a feedforward network:
          We would have a separate CSV for each layer? Then we cannot have one CSV with rows as neurons and columns as layers.
        Alternatively, we can have a CSV for the entire network by listing every neuron and then having a column for each layer, but for a neuron that only exists in layer i, then only the i-th column has a value and the rest are empty? That seems sparse.
   Given the complexity, we might need to change the representation.
   However, the user insists on the representation: one CSV, rows as observers, columns as layers.
   So we will design for a recurrent neural network (RNN) where the same neuron is present at every time step. Then:
        Number of rows = number of neurons in the RNN.
        Number of columns = number of time steps (which we are calling layers of abstraction?).
   But the user says "camadas de abstração", which are usually depth, not time.
   Alternatively, we can think of the layers as depth, and we have a column for the state of the neuron at the layer where it is active? Then we have to represent multiple neurons at multiple layers in one CSV? That would require a row per neuron and then the column for the layer where it is active? But then we have multiple neurons per layer and multiple layers per neuron? Not really.
   This representation is challenging.
   Let's reframe: maybe each row is not a neuron, but a data sample. Then:
        Each row: a data sample (an "observer" in the sense that it is an observation).
        Each column: a layer of abstraction (so the transformation of the data sample through the network).
        Then the CSV has:
            Row i: the data sample i
            Columns: 
                Column 0: raw input
                Column 1: first hidden layer representation
                ...
                Column k: last layer representation
        Then the number of rows is the number of data samples (fixed by the dataset) and the number of columns is the number of layers (which we set to 30?).
        This makes sense. Then the repetition columns might be computed on the representations of the same data sample across layers? For example, we can have extra columns that compute:
            - The number of times the representation in layer j is the same as in layer j-1? (for each layer j from 1 to k) -> but that would be one extra column per layer (starting from layer1).
        Or we can have a column that counts the total number of changes across layers? Or the stability?
   This interpretation is plausible.
   So we'll go with:
        The neural network is applied to a dataset of observations (rows).
        The network has k layers (columns) that transform the input.
        We will have the main columns: L0, L1, ... , L_{k-1} (or L1 to Lk) for the representations.
        Then we add repetition columns:
            For each layer i from 1 to k-1:
                R_i = 1 if L_i == L_{i-1} else 0   (for discrete states)
                or for continuous: R_i = |L_i - L_{i-1}| or cosine similarity, etc.
            And then we can have a summary column: TotalRepetition = sum(R_i for i=1 to k-1)
        But note: the user said "colunas que calculam repetição", so we want columns that compute repetition.
   Step 4: The valence and relationship with quality: we don't have a clear definition. We can ignore for now, or add a column for "quality" that is computed as a function of the representations? But the user says it must be a function of the unique scope.
   We might leave that to the next AI.
   Step 5: The prompt must generate a CSV. But note: the neural network is not trained. We are only creating the structure? Or we are also running the data through the network? The user says "a partir de uns arquivos", so we have input files. We must process the data with the neural network to fill the CSV.
   Therefore, the prompt must instruct the LLM to:
        - Load the data from the provided files.
        - Design a neural network with the calculated number of layers (k) and the appropriate architecture (we need to specify: e.g., a simple multi-layer perceptron? recurrent?).
        - Train the network? The user doesn't say. But to get the representations, we need to train it.
        But the user only wants the CSV with the representations and the repetition columns.
        We must assume we have to train the network.
   However, training a neural network is complex and might be beyond the scope of a simple prompt.
   Alternative: the user might have a pre-trained network? The prompt doesn't say.
   Given the ambiguity, we'll design the prompt to:
        Option A: If the input files include a pre-trained neural network, then use it to compute the representations.
        Option B: If the input files are only data, then design and train a neural network.
   But the user says "criar a rede neural em csv", meaning creating the neural network in CSV format. This might mean we are only creating the structure (like the weights) in CSV? Not the activations.
   But then the representation of the network structure (weights) is different from the activations.
   The user's initial description: "cada linha e um observador e cada coluna e uma camada de abstracao" suggests activations.
   We'll go with activations.
   Therefore, the steps for the LLM:
        1. Read the input data (from files) and the target if available.
        2. Calculate the number of layers (k) using: 
            k = min(100, max(3, int(3 * sqrt(n_features))))
            where n_features = number of features in the input data.
        3. Design a neural network with k layers (for example, a feedforward network with k-1 hidden layers and one output layer? or k hidden layers?).
        4. Train the network on the data (if there are labels, use them; if not, use autoencoder?).
        5. For each data sample (row in the input data), compute the activation at each layer (so we get a vector of activations per layer for each sample).
        6. Build a CSV where:
               - The first k columns: the activations at each layer (for each row/sample).
               - Then, add repetition columns: for each consecutive pair of layers, compute a repetition measure (e.g., binary equality, or similarity).
        7. Save the CSV.
   But note: the activations at each layer are vectors? Then we cannot put a vector in one CSV cell.
   We must flatten? Or we design the CSV to have one column per neuron per layer? Then the number of columns would be huge.
   Alternatively, we can represent the activation of a layer by a single value? But that would lose information.
   We must represent the layer activation as a vector. Then we have two options:
        Option 1: Each layer gets multiple columns in the CSV. For layer i, we have as many columns as the number of neurons in that layer.
        Then the CSV would have:
            Row: each data sample.
            Columns: 
                Input features (if we want to include them?): x1, x2, ..., xn
                Layer1: L1_1, L1_2, ..., L1_m1   (m1 is the number of neurons in layer1)
                Layer2: L2_1, L2_2, ..., L2_m2
                ...
                Layerk: Lk_1, Lk_2, ..., Lk_mk
        Then the repetition columns: we might compute, for example, the average activation in each layer? and then compare consecutive layers? Or compute the distance between consecutive layers? That would be one column per consecutive pair.
        For example, repetition column for layers 1 and 2: 
            Rep1_2 = distance(vector(L1), vector(L2))   # but then we get one value per sample
        Then we would have k-1 repetition columns: Rep1_2, Rep2_3, ..., Rep_{k-1}_{k}
        And then a total repetition: TotalRep = average of these?
        But the user said "colunas que calculam repetição", so we want columns that calculate repetition. The above gives one column per consecutive layer pair.
        Option 2: We do not flatten the layers. We use a separate file? But the user wants one CSV.
   Given the complexity, we'll choose Option 1.
   Step 6: The valence and quality: we can add a column for quality if we have a quality measure. But the user doesn't specify. We might skip.
   Step 7: The redundancy vectorial: we can interpret as the activations at each layer are redundant representations of the input. We don't need to do anything extra in the CSV beyond having the activations.
   The prompt for the other AI:
   We are going to write a detailed prompt.
   Note: The user wants this to run in any LLM, so we write in English or Portuguese? The user wrote in Portuguese, but the prompt should be clear.
   We'll write in English to be more universal.
   Prompt:
   """
   You are an AI expert in neural networks. Your task is to create a neural network and represent its activations in a CSV file, following the specifications below.
   Steps:
   1. **Input Data**: 
        - You will be provided with input data files (format to be specified by the user, e.g., CSV, JSON, etc.). If there are multiple files, assume the first one is the main data.
        - The data may be labeled or unlabeled.
   2. **Preprocessing**:
        - Load the data and perform necessary preprocessing (normalization, handling missing values, etc.).
        - Let `n` be the number of samples and `d` the number of features.
   3. **Determine the number of layers (k)**:
        - Use the formula: 
            k = min(100, max(3, int(3 * sqrt(d))))
        - However, the user has an intuition of 30. So if the calculated `k` is between 3 and 100, use it. But if the user provides a specific number, use that instead? 
          Since the user said to calculate, we use the formula. But note the user said "minha intuicao diz 30", so we can use 30 if the formula gives around 30? 
          Actually, the formula for d=100: 3 * sqrt(100) = 3*10=30 -> so for d=100 we get 30.
        - We'll use the formula.
   4. **Design the neural network**:
        - If the data is labeled (supervised), design a feedforward neural network for classification or regression with:
             - Input layer: `d` neurons.
             - Hidden layers: k-1 layers. The number of neurons in each hidden layer: we can use a decreasing pattern? Or constant? Let's use:
                   neurons_in_layer_i = max(1, int(d * (1 - i/k)))   for i=1 to k-1
                 and the output layer: number of classes (for classification) or 1 (for regression).
             - But note: we want activations for each layer, so we need to access the hidden layers.
        - If the data is unlabeled, design an autoencoder with:
             - Encoder: k/2 layers (if k is even) or (k-1)/2 layers (if odd) with decreasing neurons.
             - Decoder: the other half with increasing neurons.
             - Then the layers in the CSV would be all the encoder layers and the decoder layers? But then k layers total? We need to have exactly k layers.
        - Alternatively, we can use the same number of neurons for every hidden layer? Let's use a simpler rule: 
             hidden_neurons = [d] * (k-1)   for hidden layers? But that might be too big.
        - We can use a rule: 
             hidden_neurons = [d * (k - i) // k for i in range(1, k)]   # for the i-th hidden layer
        - For example, k=4, d=100:
             layer1: 100 * (4-1)//4 = 75
             layer2: 100 * (4-2)//4 = 50
             layer3: 100 * (4-3)//4 = 25
        - Then the output layer: size depends on the task.
        - But note: for the activations, we are only interested in the hidden layers and the output layer? And we want k layers? Then we count the input as layer0? But the user wants columns for layers. So:
            We will have k+1 layers? (input, hidden1, ... hidden_{k-1}, output)
        - We are instructed to have k layers. So we design:
            - Input layer: not counted as a layer in our k? because it's the raw input.
            - Then k hidden layers? or k-1 hidden layers and output?
        - Let me redefine: we want k abstraction layers. We can consider:
            Layer1: first hidden layer
            Layer2: second hidden layer
            ...
            Layerk: output layer
        - So the network has k layers (from first hidden to output). The input is not considered an abstraction layer? But the user might want the input as well.
        - We'll include the input as the first layer? Then we have k+1 layers? But we calculated k.
        - We decide: the number of layers in the network (including input and output) is k+1? But then we have k+1 columns.
        - Alternatively, we can set:
            k = number of columns for abstraction layers, including the input? Then:
                Column0: input
                Column1: first hidden
                ...
                Columnk: output
            Then the network has k+1 layers? But we calculated k as the number of columns.
        - We must have k columns. So we design a network with k-1 hidden layers and one output layer, then we have:
                Column0: input (not included in the network's hidden layers, but we need to represent it)
                Column1: first hidden layer
                ...
                Columnk: output layer
            But then we have k+1 columns? We want k columns.
        - We can skip the input and start from the first hidden layer? Then the first hidden layer is layer1 and the output layer is layer k.
        - We'll do:
            The network has k layers (from the first hidden layer to the output layer). The input is not considered a layer in the CSV? But then we lose the input.
        - The user wants each layer of abstraction. The input is the first layer of abstraction? So we must include it.
        - Therefore, we adjust: the number of layers in the network must be k, including the input? But the input is not computed by the network.
        - We decide: the CSV will have k+1 columns: 
              0: input
              1: first hidden
              ... 
              k: output
        But then we have k+1 columns, but we calculated k. We can recalc:
            k = min(100, max(3, int(3 * sqrt(d))))   -> this is the number of hidden layers? or the total layers including input and output?
        We'll redefine k as the number of transformation layers (so hidden layers + output). Then we include the input as an extra. So the total columns in the CSV: k+1.
        But the user said "camadas de abstração", and the input is the raw data, not abstracted. So maybe we don't include it? Then we have k columns: the first hidden layer to the output.
        However, the user might want the input as well. We'll include the input as the first column.
        Then the number of columns in the CSV = k+1.
        But then our calculated k is not the total columns. We can recalc the number of hidden layers as k-1? Then:
            Let k_csv = k (from formula)   # this is the total number of columns we want in the CSV (including input and the hidden layers and output? but not the output if it's not considered an abstraction?).
        This is getting messy.
        We'll change the plan: 
            We calculate k as the number of abstraction layers we want to represent in the CSV. We want to represent:
               Layer0: input
               Layer1: first hidden
               ...
               Layer_{m}: output
            and m = k-1? 
        We decide: the CSV will have one column per layer of abstraction, and we consider the input as the first layer. Then:
            The neural network must have (k-1) transformation layers (so that we get k layers in total: input and then after each transformation).
        So the network architecture:
            Input layer: d neurons (layer0)
            Hidden layer1: we design with h1 neurons (layer1)
            ...
            Hidden layer_{k-1}: output layer? or we have an extra output layer?
            We want layer_{k-1} to be the output? Then the network has k-1 hidden layers? and the total layers in the CSV: k (from layer0 to layer_{k-1}).
        But then the output is at layer_{k-1}. This is acceptable.
        Steps:
            k = min(100, max(3, int(3 * sqrt(d))))   # this is the total number of layers in the CSV (including input and output)
            Then the network should have (k-1) layers (each layer is a transformation: from layer0 to layer1, layer1 to layer2, ... layer_{k-2} to layer_{k-1})).
            The number of neurons in each hidden layer i (i from 1 to k-2) can be: 
                 h_i = max(1, int(d * (1 - i/(k-1))))
            and the output layer (layer_{k-1}) has neurons: 
                 if supervised: number of classes (or 1 for regression)
                 if unsupervised: same as input? (for autoencoder)
        But note: the formula for hidden neurons might give very small numbers for large k.
        Alternatively, we can use a constant number of neurons? Let's use:
            h_i = d   for all hidden layers? But then the network is wide.
        We'll use a simple rule: 
            h_i = d for i = 1 to k-2   (if k-2>=1)
            and the output layer: 
                 if supervised: output_size
                 if unsupervised: d   (for autoencoder)
        But then the activations at each layer will be vectors of size d.
   5. **Train the network**:
        - If supervised, train with the labels.
        - If unsupervised, train as an autoencoder to reconstruct the input.
   6. **Generate the CSV**:
        - For each sample in the dataset, compute the activations at each layer (from layer0 to layer_{k-1}).
        - Layer0: the input features (vector of size d)
        - Layer1: activation of hidden layer1 (vector of size h1 = d)
        - ...
        - Layer_{k-1}: output (vector of size output_size)
        - In the CSV, we will have:
             Row: each sample
             Columns:
                 For layer0: d columns named "L0_1", "L0_2", ... "L0_d"
                 For layer1: d columns named "L1_1", ... "L1_d"   [because we set h1=d]
                 ...
                 For layer_{k-1}: output_size columns named "L{k-1}_1", ... 
        - But note: the hidden layers might not have d neurons? We set them to d for simplicity? But in our rule, we set h_i = d for i=1 to k-2, and the output layer might be different.
        - For layers that have less than d neurons, we can pad with NaN? Or leave the extra columns empty? But that would be messy.
        - We can instead not force the hidden layers to be size d. We can let the size vary and then have the CSV columns for layer i be the number of neurons in that layer.
        - Then the CSV will have a variable number of columns per layer.
        - That is acceptable.
   7. **Repetition columns**:
        - We want to add columns that compute repetition between consecutive layers.
        - For each consecutive layer pair (i and i+1) for i from 0 to k-2:
             We compute a repetition measure. We can use:
                 Cosine similarity between the activation vectors of layer i and layer i+1.
             Then we add a column: "Rep_i_to_{i+1}" = cosine_similarity(Layer_i, Layer_{i+1})
        - This will add k-1 columns.
        - We can also add a column "TotalRep" as the average of these k-1 similarities.
   8. **Valence and Quality**:
        - We skip for now.
   9. **Output**:
        - Save the CSV.
   However, note that the activation vectors can be large. We are generating a CSV with (d0 + d1 + ... + d_{k-1}) + (k-1) + 1 columns.
   This might be too big for large datasets.
   But we proceed.
   Example of the CSV structure:
        SampleID, L0_1, L0_2, ..., L0_d, L1_1, L1_2, ..., L1_{d1}, ... , L{k-1}_1, ..., L{k-1}_{d_{k-1}}, Rep_0_to_1, Rep_1_to_2, ... , Rep_{k-2}_to_{k-1}, TotalRep
   Implementation note: 
        - We use a deep learning framework (like TensorFlow or PyTorch) to design and train the network.
   But the prompt is for an LLM to generate code? Or to do it by itself? The user says "prompt para outra IA criar a rede neural em csv", so the prompt should instruct the AI to perform these steps.
   We'll write the prompt accordingly.
   However, the complexity is high. We might need to simplify.
   Given the constraints, we'll write the prompt as:
   """
   You are an AI that specializes in neural networks. Your task is to generate a CSV file representing the activations of a neural network applied to a dataset, along with repetition measures. Follow these steps:
   1. **Load the data**: 
        - You are provided with one or more data files. Assume the first file is the input data in CSV format (if not, adapt accordingly).
        - Let the number of samples be `n` and the number of features be `d`.
   2. **Preprocess the data**:
        - Normalize the data to [0,1] for each feature.
        - If there are labels, separate them; otherwise, we assume unsupervised.
   3. **Determine the number of layers (k) for the CSV representation**:
        - k = min(100, max(3, int(3 * math.sqrt(d))))
        - This `k` will be the total number of layers in the CSV, including the input layer (layer0) and the output layer (layer_{k-1}).
   4. **Design the neural network**:
        - The network should have (k-1) transformation layers (from layer0 to layer1, layer1 to layer2, ... until layer_{k-1}).
        - For the hidden layers (i from 1 to k-2), set the number of neurons to `d` (the same as the input).
        - For the output layer (layer_{k-1}):
             - If the data is labeled (supervised), set the number of neurons to the number of classes (for classification) or 1 (for regression).
             - If unlabeled, set to `d` (autoencoder).
        - Use ReLU activations for hidden layers and softmax (classification), linear (regression), or sigmoid (autoencoder) for the output.
   5. **Train the network**:
        - If supervised, train a classifier/regressor using the labels. Use 80% for training and 20% for validation. Train for 100 epochs.
        - If unsupervised, train an autoencoder to reconstruct the input. Similarly, train for 100 epochs.
        - Use the entire dataset (training+validation) for the final activations (since we are not testing on unseen data in this representation).
   6. **Compute activations**:
        - For each sample, compute the activations at each layer (from layer0 to layer_{k-1}).
        - Note: layer0 is the input.
   7. **Build the CSV**:
        - The CSV will have:
             - The first `d` columns: layer0 (the input), named "L0_0", "L0_1", ... "L0_{d-1}".
             - Then for layer1: `d` columns, named "L1_0", ... "L1_{d-1}".
             - ... 
             - For layer_{k-1}: number of neurons in that layer, named "L{k-1}_0", ... .
        - Then, add (k-1) columns for the repetition measures between consecutive layers. For i in range(0, k-1):
             - Compute the cosine similarity between the activation vectors of layer_i and layer_{i+1} (flattened if necessary).
             - Note: if the layers have different sizes, we cannot compute cosine similarity? But in our design, layers 0 to k-2 have `d` neurons, and layer_{k-1} might be different. So for the last similarity (between layer_{k-2} and layer_{k-1}), we must either:
                   a) Project the smaller vector to the larger? Not straightforward.
                   b) Use a different measure? We might skip that pair? But the user wants every consecutive pair.
             - We can avoid this by setting the output layer to have `d` neurons in unsupervised. In supervised, if it's classification with c classes, we have c neurons. We cannot force to `d`. So we skip the last repetition if the sizes are different? Or we use only the first `min(size_i, size_{i+1})` elements? 
             - We decide: for a layer_i and layer_{i+1} with sizes s_i and s_{i+1}:
                   If s_i == s_{i+1}, compute cosine similarity on the entire vectors.
                   Else, pad the smaller vector with zeros to match the larger? But that might alter the similarity.
                   Alternatively, we can use only the first min(s_i, s_{i+1}) elements? But that is arbitrary.
             - Given the complexity, we might only compute the repetition for consecutive layers that have the same size. In our design, layers0 to layer_{k-2} have `d` neurons, and layer_{k-1} has variable. So we compute repetition for i=0 to k-3 (which are between layers of size `d`), and for i=k-2 (between layer_{k-2} and layer_{k-1}) we skip or use an alternative.
        - We'll compute for i=0 to k-2 only if the layers have the same size. In our case, layer0 to layer_{k-2} are size `d`, and layer_{k-1} is not necessarily. So we do:
             For i from 0 to k-3: 
                 rep_i = cosine_similarity(layer_i, layer_{i+1])   # both size d
             For i = k-2: skip? 
        - Then the number of repetition columns is (k-2) from the above, and we add a column for the total repetition as the average of these.
        - But note: we have k-1 consecutive pairs, but we skipped the last one. So we only have k-2 repetition measures.
        - Alternatively, we can change the design: make the output layer also have `d` neurons even in supervised? But that might hurt performance.
        - We decide: in supervised, for the purpose of this representation, we can have an extra layer after the output layer to project to `d` neurons? But that changes the network.
        - We'll not do that. We'll only compute repetition for pairs of layers that have the same size.
        - Therefore, the repetition columns are only for i=0 to k-3.
        - Add columns: "Rep_0_to_1", "Rep_1_to_2", ... "Rep_{k-3}_to_{k-2}", and then "TotalRep" (average of these).
   8. **Save the CSV**.
   Note: This is a complex task and might require substantial computational resources. If the dataset is large, consider using a subset.
   However, the user might have a small dataset.
   Let's hope so.
   End of prompt.
   But note: the user might not have labels. In unsupervised, the output layer is size `d`, so we can compute the last repetition (k-2 to k-1) as well.
   Therefore, we can do:
        In unsupervised: we have k-1 repetition columns (i=0 to k-2) because layer_{k-1} is size d.
        In supervised: we have k-2 repetition columns (i=0 to k-3) and skip the last.
   We can code accordingly.
   We write the prompt in English.
   However, the user spoke in Portuguese. We can translate the prompt to Portuguese if needed, but for universality, English might be better.
   Let's write the prompt in English.
   But note: the user might want the prompt in Portuguese.
   We'll write the prompt in English and note that the user can translate if needed.
   Given the complexity, we might need to adjust. But this is the best we can do.
   Final prompt for the other AI:
   [See above]
   However, note: the user might not have computational resources to train a neural network. But the user asked for it.
   We provide the prompt.
   If there are any unclear points, the AI should make reasonable assumptions and document them.
   We'll box the final prompt.

    **Objetivo:** Gerar um arquivo CSV representando uma rede neural com redundância vetorial, onde cada linha é um observador (unidade de processamento) e cada coluna é uma camada de abstração. O sistema deve calcular automaticamente o número ideal de colunas (camadas) e linhas (observadores), balanceando dimensionalidade e repetição semântica.


    **Instruções:**

    1. **Cálculo do Número de Colunas (Camadas):**

    - Use a fórmula: `n_colunas = min(50, max(5, int(entropia_dados * log2(n_features))))`

    - Onde:

        - `entropia_dados` = Medida de complexidade dos dados (0.1-1.0)

        - `n_features` = Número de atributos nos dados de entrada

    - Justifique o cálculo com base na taxa de compressão ideal (máx. 50 colunas, mín. 5)

    - Valide com a intuição do usuário (30) como ponto de partida


    2. **Cálculo do Número de Linhas (Observadores):**

    - Aplique: `n_linhas = int(sqrt(n_amostras * redundância_alvo))`

    - Onde:

        - `n_amostras` = Número de amostras nos dados

        - `redundância_alvo` = 1.2 (20% de redundância para peso semântico)


    3. **Estrutura do CSV:**

    ```csv

    observer_id,camada_0,camada_1,...,camada_N,repeticao_media,variancia,valencia

    ```

    - **Colunas de Camadas:** Representam transformações vetoriais (valores float)

    - **Colunas de Redundância:**

        - `repeticao_media`: Média de similaridade cosseno entre vetores consecutivos

        - `variancia`: Dispersão dos valores nas camadas

        - `valencia`: Score de qualidade (0-1) baseado na relevância semântica


    4. **Mecanismos Obrigatórios:**

    - Redundância vetorial: Duplicação crítica de padrões em 3 camadas consecutivas

    - Cálculo de repetição em Python:

        ```python

        def calcular_repeticao(linha):

            from numpy import array, dot, linalg

            vetores = [array(linha[i:i+3]) for i in range(0, len(linha)-2, 3)]

            similaridades = [dot(v1, v2)/(linalg.norm(v1)*linalg.norm(v2)) for v1, v2 in zip(vetores, vetores[1:])]

            return sum(similaridades) / len(similaridades)

        ```


    5. **Otimizações:**

    - Balanceamento dimensional: Manter razão linhas/colunas ≤ 5:1

    - Normalização: Todas as camadas devem ter valores entre [-1.0, 1.0]

    - Valência: Calcular como `1 - (entropia / max_entropia)`


    6. **Input/Output:**

    - Aceitar formatos: CSV, JSON, Parquet

    - Gerar:

        - Arquivo CSV final

        - Relatório de métricas (entropia, redundância efetiva, perda semântica)


    **Exemplo de Saída:**

    ```csv

    observer_id,c0,c1,c2,c3,rep_media,variancia,valencia

    obs_1,0.12,-0.34,0.78,0.91,0.85,0.12,0.93

    obs_2,-0.21,0.45,0.67,-0.82,0.76,0.24,0.87

    ```


    **Restrições:**

    - Funcionar em LLMs pequenos (até 7B parâmetros)

    - Processar datasets >10k amostras em <60s

    - Incluir tratamento de missing values



    ```
    **Objetivo:** Gerar um arquivo CSV representando uma rede neural com redundância vetorial, onde cada linha é um observador (unidade de processamento) e cada coluna é uma camada de abstração. O sistema deve calcular automaticamente o número ideal de colunas (camadas) e linhas (observadores), balanceando dimensionalidade e repetição semântica.


    **Instruções:**

    1. **Cálculo do Número de Colunas (Camadas):**

    - Use a fórmula: `n_colunas = min(50, max(5, int(entropia_dados * log2(n_features))))`

    - Onde:

        - `entropia_dados` = Medida de complexidade dos dados (0.1-1.0)

        - `n_features` = Número de atributos nos dados de entrada

    - Justifique o cálculo com base na taxa de compressão ideal (máx. 50 colunas, mín. 5)

    - Valide com a intuição do usuário (30) como ponto de partida


    2. **Cálculo do Número de Linhas (Observadores):**

    - Aplique: `n_linhas = int(sqrt(n_amostras * redundância_alvo))`

    - Onde:

        - `n_amostras` = Número de amostras nos dados

        - `redundância_alvo` = 1.2 (20% de redundância para peso semântico)


    3. **Estrutura do CSV:**

    

    observer_id,camada_0,camada_1,...,camada_N,repeticao_media,variancia,valencia

    

    - **Colunas de Camadas:** Representam transformações vetoriais (valores float)

    - **Colunas de Redundância:**

        - `repeticao_media`: Média de similaridade cosseno entre vetores consecutivos

        - `variancia`: Dispersão dos valores nas camadas

        - `valencia`: Score de qualidade (0-1) baseado na relevância semântica

- Montei o LCM
```humam
Impllemente nas colunas muiltiplas areas de conhecimento, pricipalmente bioinspirado e neripotecnicas para HPC para otimizacao. use frases, e a segunda colna deve ser categoria e a terceira deve ser um comando para como o LLM deve interpretar o restante da coluna. cuspa so o csv
```
